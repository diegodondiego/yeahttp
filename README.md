# y(yet)a(another)http tool

this library is only for me to learn newer versions of Java and implement it from scratch. this library is intended to become a mix of 
okhttp and retrofit.

## ideas

1. create a interface, configure with annotations their methods to represents the HTTP calls (like retrofit)
2. build all the calls with the less amount of third-party code
